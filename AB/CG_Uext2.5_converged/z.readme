This script coarse grains an AB Gaussian fluid to a coarser system.
The reference system is an ideal mixture (chi=0), with Uext=2.5.

The "physical answer" is that the AB fluid should be coarse grained to an ideal fluid as well. Uext2.5 leads to significantly better results than Uext=0.0 or Uext=0.5.
    With these short trajectories, however, there is still some noise and fluctuations that prevents the recovery of ideal solution behavior.

To run: 
    python run.py
