This script coarse grains an AB Gaussian fluid to a coarser system.
The reference system is an ideal mixture (chi=0), with Uext=0.5.

The "physical answer" is that the AB fluid should be coarse grained to an ideal fluid as well. While Uext=0.5 improves upon Uext=0.0, it is still insufficient to produce an ideal solution.

To run: 
    python run.py
